            Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You
            sense the direction to the object's location, as long as
            that object is within 1,000 feet of you. If the object is in
            motion, you know the direction of its movement.

            The spell can locate a specific object known to you,
            as long as you have seen it up close—within 30 feet—at
            least once. Alternatively, the spell can locate the nearest
            object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of
            apparel, jewelry, furniture, tool, or w eapon.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell can't locate an object if any thickness of
            lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you
            and the object.
