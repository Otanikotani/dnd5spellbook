            Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within
            range. Any spell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            For each spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make
            an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The
            DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a successful check,
            the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 4th level or higher, you automatically end
            the effects of a spell on the target if the spell's level is
            equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.
