            You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing
            ability. The target regains <b>4d8 + 15</b> hit points. For the
            duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit point at the
            start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute).

            </p>
            <p>
            The target's severed body members (fingers, legs,
            tails, and so on), if any, are restored after 2 minutes.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump,
            the spell instantaneously causes the limb to knit
            to the stump.
