            This spell shapes a creature's dreams. Choose a
            creature known to you as the target of this spell. The
            target must be on the same plane of existence as you.

            </p>
            <p>
            Creatures that don't sleep, such as elves, can't be
            contacted by this spell. You, or a w illing creature you
            touch, enters a trance state, acting as a m essenger.

            </p>
            <p>
            While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or
            her surroundings, but can't take actions or move.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the
            target's dreams and can converse with the target as
            long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the
            spell. The messenger can also shape the environment
            of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other
            images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at
            any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target
            recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is
            awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it,
            and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for
            the target tofall asleep, at which point the messenger
            appears in the target's dreams.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can make the messenger appear monstrous
            and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger
            can deliver a message of no more than ten words and
            then the target must make a W isdom saving throw. On
            a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity
            spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target's
            sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit
            from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it
            takes <b>3d6 </b>psychic damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a
            nail, or similar portion of the target's body, the target
            makes its saving throw with disadvantage.
