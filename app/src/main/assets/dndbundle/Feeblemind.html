            You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within
            range, attempting to shatter its intellect and personality.

            </p>
            <p>
            The target takes <b>4d6 </b>psychic damage and must make an
            Intelligence saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and
            Charisma scores become 1. The creature can't cast
            spells, activate magic items, understand language, or
            communicate in any intelligible way. The creature can,
            however, identify its friends, follow them, and even
            protect them.

            </p>
            <p>
            At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat
            its saving throw against this spell. If it succeeds on its
            saving throw, the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell can also be ended by greater restoration,
            heal, or wish.
