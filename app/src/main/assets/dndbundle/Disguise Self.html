            You make yourself—including your clothing, armor,
            weapons, and other belongings on your person—look
            different until the spell ends or until you u se your action
            to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and
            can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change
            your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the
            same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent
            of the illusion is up to you.

            The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to
            physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell
            to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat,
            and anyone w ho touches it w ould feel nothing or would
            feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear
            thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches
            out to touch you would bump into you while it was
            seemingly still in midair.

            To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use
            its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed
            on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your
            spell save DC.
