            You hurl a 4-inch-diameter sphere of energy at a
            creature that you can see within range. You choose
            acid, cold, fire, lightning, poison, or thunder for the type
            of orb you create, and then make a ranged spell attack
            against the target. If the attack hits, the creature takes
            <b>3d8 </b>damage of the type you chose.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 1st.
