            A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you,
            masking you and your companions from detection.

            For the duration, each creature you choose within 30
            feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity
            (Stealth) checks and can't be tracked except by m agical
            means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves
            behind no tracks or other traces of its passage.
