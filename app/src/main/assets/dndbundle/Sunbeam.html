            A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand
            in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in
            the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
            failed save, a creature takes <b>6d8 </b>radiant damage and
            is blinded until your next turn. On a successful save,
            it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded by this
            spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this
            saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can create a new line of radiance as your action
            on any turn until the spell ends.

            <p>
            For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in
            your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and
            dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.
