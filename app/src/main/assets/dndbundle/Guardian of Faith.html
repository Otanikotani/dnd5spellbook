            A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the
            duration in an unoccupied space of your choice that you
            can see within range. The guardian occupies that space
            and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield
            emblazoned with the symbol of your deity.

            </p>
            <p>
            Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space
            within 10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a
            turn must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. The
            creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or
            half as much damage on a successful one. The guardian
            vanishes when it has dealt a total of 60 damage.
