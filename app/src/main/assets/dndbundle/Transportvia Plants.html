            This spell creates a magical link between a Large or
            larger inanimate plant within range and another plant,
            at any distance, on the same plane of existence. You
            must have seen or touched the destination plant at least
            once before. For the duration, any creature can step into
            the target plant and exit from the destination plant by
            using 5 feet of movement.
