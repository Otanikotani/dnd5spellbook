            A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell
            ends. Anything the target is w earing or carrying is
            invisible as long as it is on the target's person. The spell
            ends for a target that attacks or casts a spell.

            </p>

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you can target one
            additional creature for each slot level above 2nd.
