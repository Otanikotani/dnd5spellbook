            A ray of sickening greenish energy lashes out toward
            a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack
            against the target. On a hit, the target takes <b>2d8 </b>poison
            damage and must make a Constitution saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            On a failed save, it is also poisoned until the end of
            your next turn.

            </p>

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 1st.
