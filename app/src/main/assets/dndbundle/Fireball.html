            A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a
            point you choose within range and then blossoms with
            a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature
            in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must
            make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes <b>8d6 </b>fire
            damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
            successful one.

            The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable
            objects in the area that aren't being w orn or carried.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d6 </b>for each slot level above 3rd.
