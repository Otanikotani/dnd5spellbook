            This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific
            area. There are two possible uses for the spell, granting
            either immediate or long-term benefits.

            If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point
            within range. All normal plants in a 100-foot radius
            centered on that point become thick and overgrown. A
            creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of
            movement for every 1 foot it moves.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can exclude one or more areas of any size within
            the spell's area from being affected.

            If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the
            land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point
            within range become enriched for 1 year. The plants
            yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested.
