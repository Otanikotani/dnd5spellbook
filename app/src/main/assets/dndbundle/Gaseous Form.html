            You transform a willing creature you touch, along with
            everything it's wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud
            for the duration. The spell ends if the creature drops to
            0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn't affected.

            While in this form, the target's only method of
            movement is a flying speed of 10 feet. The target can
            enter and occupy the space of another creature. The
            target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has
            advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution
            saving throws. The target can pass through small holes,
            narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats
            liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The target
            can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when
            stunned or otherwise incapacitated.

            </p>
            <p>
            While in the form of a misty cloud, the target can't talk
            or manipulate objects, and any objects it w as carrying or
            holding can't be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted
            with. The target can't attack or cast spells.
