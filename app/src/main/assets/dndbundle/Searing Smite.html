            The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon
            attack during the spell's duration, your w eapon flares
            with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra
            <b>1d6 </b>fire damage to the target and causes the target to
            ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until
            the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution
            saving throw. On a failed save, it takes <b>1d6 </b>fire damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or a
            creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the
            flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such
            as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial extra damage
            dealt by the attack increases by <b>1d6 </b>for each slot
            level above 1st.
