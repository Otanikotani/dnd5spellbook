            For the duration, you know if there is an aberration,
            celestial, elemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30
            feet of you, as well as where the creature is located.

            <p>
            Similarly, you know if there is a place or object within
            30 feet of you that has been magically consecrated
            or desecrated.

            </p>

            The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked
            by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet
            of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
