            You ward a creature within range against attack. Until
            the spell ends, any creature who targets the warded
            creature with an attack or a harmful spell must first
            make a W isdom saving throw. On a failed save, the
            creature must choose a new target or lose the attack
            or spell. This spell doesn't protect the w arded creature
            from area effects, such as the explosion of a fireball.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell
            that affects an enemy creature, this spell ends.
