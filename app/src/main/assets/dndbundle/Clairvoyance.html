            You create an invisible sensor within range in a location
            familiar to you (a place you have visited or seen before)
            or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar to you (such
            as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees).

            </p>
            <p>
            The sensor remains in place for the duration, and it
            can't be attacked or otherwise interacted with.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or
            hearing. You can use the chosen sense through the
            sensor as if you were in its space. A s your action, you
            can switch between seeing and hearing.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature
            benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees a
            luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist.
