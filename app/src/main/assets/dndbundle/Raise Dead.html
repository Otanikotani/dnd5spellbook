            You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided
            that it has been dead no longer than 10 days. If the
            creature's soul is both w illing and at liberty to rejoin the
            body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point.

            </p>

            This spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures
            nonmagical diseases that affected the creature at the
            time it died. This spell doesn't, however, remove magical
            diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren't first
            removed prior to casting the spell, they take effect when
            the creature returns to life. The spell can't return an
            undead creature to life.

            </p>

            This spell closes all mortal w ounds, but it doesn't
            restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking
            body parts or organs integral for its survival—its head,
            for instance—the spell automatically fails.

            </p>

            Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target
            takes a - 4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and
            ability checks. Every time the target finishes a long rest,
            the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears.
