            A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a
            20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a
            point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must
            make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes <b>2d8</b>
            bludgeoning damage and <b>4d6 </b>cold damage on a failed
            save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into difficult
            terrain until the end of your next turn.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage
            increases by <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 4th.
