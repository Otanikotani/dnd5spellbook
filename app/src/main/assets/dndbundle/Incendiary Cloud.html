            A swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot
            embers appears in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on
            a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners
            and is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until
            a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles
            per hour) disperses it.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the cloud appears, each creature in it must
            make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes <b>10d8</b>
            fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
            a successful one. A creature must also make this saving
            throw when it enters the spell's area for the first time on
            a turn or ends its turn there.

            </p>
            <p>
            The cloud moves 10 feet directly away from you
            in a direction that you choose at the start of each
            of your turns.
