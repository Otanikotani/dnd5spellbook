            One humanoid of your choice that you can see within
            range must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or
            become charmed by you for the duration. While
            the target is charmed in this way, a twisted crown
            of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness
            glows in its eyes.

            </p>
            <p>
            The charmed target must use its action before moving
            on each of its turns to make a melee attack against a
            creature other than itself that you mentally choose.

            </p>
            <p>
            Material Duration
            Vegetable matter 1 day
            Stone or crystal 12 hours
            Precious metals 1 hour
            Gems 10 minutes
            Adamantine or mithral 1 minute
            The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no
            creature or if none are within its reach.

            </p>
            <p>
            On your subsequent turns, you must use your action to
            maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Also,
            the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end
            of each of its turns. On a success, the spell ends.
