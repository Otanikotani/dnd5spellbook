            You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that
            you can see within range. The target must make a
            Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes
            <b>14d6 </b>necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a
            successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's
            hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw,
            its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an
            amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect
            that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point
            maximum to return to normal before that time passes.
