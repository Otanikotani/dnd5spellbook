            <p>
            The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is
            imbued with nature's power. For the duration, you can
            use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength for
            the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using
            that w eapon, and the weapon's damage die becomes
            a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn't
            already. The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go
            of the weapon.
