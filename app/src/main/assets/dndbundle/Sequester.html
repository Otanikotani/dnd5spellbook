            By means of this spell, a willing creature or an object
            can be hidden away, safe from detection for the
            duration. When you cast the spell and touch the target,
            it becomes invisible and can't be targeted by divination
            spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by
            divination spells.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the target is a creature, it falls into a state of
            suspended animation. Time ceases toflow for it, and it
            doesn't grow older.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can set a condition for the spell to end early.

            </p>
            <p>
            The condition can be anything you choose, but it
            must occur or be visible within 1 mile of the target.

            </p>
            <p>
            Examples include “after 1,000 years” or “when the
            tarrasque awakens.” This spell also ends if the target
            takes any damage.
