            You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or
            some other visible phenomenon within range that
            activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion
            is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a
            30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell
            how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This
            scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the condition you specify occurs, the illusion
            springs into existence and performs in the manner you
            described. Once the illusion finishes performing, it
            disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After
            this time, the illusion can be activated again.

            </p>
            <p>
            The triggering condition can be as general or as
            detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or
            audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area.

            </p>
            <p>
            For example, you could create an illusion of yourself
            to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a
            trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only
            when a creature says the correct w ord or phrase.

            </p>

            Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
            illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
            that uses its action to examine the image can determine
            that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
            (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a
            creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature
            can see through the image, and any noise it makes
            sounds hollow to the creature.
