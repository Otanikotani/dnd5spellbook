            A spectral, floating hand appears at a point you choose
            within range. The hand lasts for the duration or until
            you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is
            ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast
            this spell again.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can use your action to control the hand. You can
            use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked
            door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open
            container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can
            move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.

            </p>
            <p>
            The hand can't attack, activate magic items, or carry
            more than 10 pounds.
