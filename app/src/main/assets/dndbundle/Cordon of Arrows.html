            You plant four pieces of nonmagical ammunition—
            arrows or crossbow bolts—in the ground within range
            and lay m agic upon them to protect an area. Until the
            spell ends, whenever a creature other than you comes
            within 30 feet of the ammunition for the first time on a
            turn or ends its turn there, one piece of ammunition flies
            up to strike it. The creature must succeed on a Dexterity
            saving throw or take <b>1d6 </b>piercing damage. The piece of
            ammunition is then destroyed. The spell ends when no
            ammunition remains.
