            You create up tofour torch-sized lights within range,
            making them appear as torches, lanterns, or glowing
            orbs that hover in the air for the duration. You can
            also combine the four lights into one glowing vaguely
            humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you
            choose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.

            As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the
            lights up to 60 feet to a new spot within range. A light
            must be within 20 feet of another light created by this
            spell, and a light winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
