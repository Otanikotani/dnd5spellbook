            You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating
            gas centered on a point within range. The cloud spreads
            around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. The
            cloud lingers in the air for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each creature that is completely within the cloud at
            the start of its turn must make a Constitution saving
            throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature
            spends its action that turn retching and reeling.

            </p>
            <p>
            Creatures that don't need to breathe or are immune to
            poison automatically succeed on this saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            A moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses
            the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20
            miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round.
