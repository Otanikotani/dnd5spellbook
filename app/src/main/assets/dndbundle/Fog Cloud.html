            You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a
            point within range. The sphere spreads around corners,
            and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration
            or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10
            miles per hour) disperses it.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog
            increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.
