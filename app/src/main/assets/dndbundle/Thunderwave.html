            A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each
            creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must
            make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a
            creature takes <b>2d8 </b>thunder damage and is pushed 10
            feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature
            takes half as much damage and isn't pushed.

            </p>
            <p>
            In addition, unsecured objects that are completely
            within the area of effect are automatically pushed 10 feet
            away from you by the spell's effect, and the spell emits a
            thunderous boom audible out to 300 feet.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 1st.
