            You bring forth a great feast, including magnificent
            food and drink. The feast takes 1 hour to consume and
            disappears at the end of that time, and the beneficial
            effects don't set in until this hour is over. Up to twelve
            other creatures can partake of the feast.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature that partakes of the feast gains several
            benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and
            poison, becomes immune to poison and being
            frightened, and makes all W isdom saving throws with
            advantage. Its hit point maximum also increases by
            <b>2d10</b>, and it gains the same number of hit points. These
            benefits last for 24 hours.
