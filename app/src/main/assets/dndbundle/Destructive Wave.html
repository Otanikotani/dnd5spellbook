            You strike the ground, creating a burst of divine
            energy that ripples outward from you. Each creature
            you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a
            Constitution saving throw or take <b>5d6 </b>thunder damage,
            as well as <b>5d6 </b>radiant or necrotic damage (your choice),
            and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on
            its saving throw takes half as much damage and isn't
            knocked prone.
