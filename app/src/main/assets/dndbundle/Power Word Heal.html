            A wave of healing energy washes over the creature
            you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the
            creature is charmed, frightened, paralyzed, or stunned,
            the condition ends. If the creature is prone, it can use its
            reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead
            or constructs.
