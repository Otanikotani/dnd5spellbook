            A dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from
            your hand. Roll 6 d10; the total is how many hit points
            of creatures this spell can effect. Creatures in a 15-foot
            cone originating from you are affected in ascending
            order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious
            creatures and creatures that can't see).

            </p>
            <p>
            Starting with the creature that has the lowest current
            hit points, each creature affected by this spell is blinded
            until the spell ends. Subtract each creature's hit points
            from the total before moving on to the creature with
            the next lowest hit points. A creature's hit points must
            be equal to or less than the remaining total for that
            creature to be affected.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 2nd level or higher, roll an additional <b>2d10</b>
            for each slot level above 1st.
