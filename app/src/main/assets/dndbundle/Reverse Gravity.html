            This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-
            foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. All
            creatures and objects that aren't somehow anchored to
            the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of
            the area when you cast this spell. A creature can make a
            Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can
            reach, thus avoiding the fall.

            </p>
            <p>
            If some solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered
            in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it just as
            they would during a normal downward fall. If an object
            or creature reaches the top of the area without striking
            anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for
            the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            At the end of the duration, affected objects and
            creatures fall back down.
