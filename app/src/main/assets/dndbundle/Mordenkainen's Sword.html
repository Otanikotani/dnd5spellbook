            You create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers
            within range. It lasts for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the sword appears, you make a melee spell
            attack against a target of your choice within 5 feet of the
            sword. On a hit. the target takes <b>3d10 </b>force damage.

            </p>

            decide the visual appearance of these servants and their
            attire. They are completely obedient to your orders.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each servant can perform any task a normal human
            servant could perform, but they can't attack or take
            any action that would directly harm another creature.

            </p>
            <p>
            Thus the servants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold
            clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on.

            </p>
            <p>
            The servants can go anywhere in the mansion but
            can't leave it. Furnishings and other objects created
            by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the
            mansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside
            the extradimensional space are expelled into the open
            spaces nearest to the entrance.

            </p>
            <p>
            Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each
            of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet to a spot
            you can see and repeat this attack against the same
            target or a different one.
