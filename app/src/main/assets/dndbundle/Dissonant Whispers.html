            You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature
            of your choice within range can hear, wracking it with
            terrible pain. The target must m ake a Wisdom saving
            throw. On a failed save, it takes <b>3d6 </b>psychic damage and
            must immediately use its reaction, if available, to move
            as far as its speed allows away from you. The creature
            doesn't move into obviously dangerous ground, such
            as a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes
            half as much damage and doesn't have to move away. A
            deafened creature automatically succeeds on the save.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d6 </b>for each slot level above 1st.
