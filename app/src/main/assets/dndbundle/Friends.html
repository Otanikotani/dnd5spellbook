            For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma
            checks directed at one creature of your choice that isn't
            hostile toward you. When the spell ends, the creature
            realizes that you used magic to influence its mood
            and becomes hostile toward you. A creature prone
            to violence might attack you. Another creature might
            seek retribution in other ways (at the DM's discretion),
            depending on the nature of your interaction with it.
