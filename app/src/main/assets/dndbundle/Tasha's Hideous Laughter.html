            A creature of your choice that you can see within range
            perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls
            intofits of laughter if this spell affects it. The target
            must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or fall prone,
            becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the
            duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 4 or
            less isn't affected.

            </p>
            <p>
            At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes
            damage, the target can make another W isdom saving
            throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if
            it's triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.
