            Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered
            on a point you choose within range. Each creature in
            that light must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
            failed save, a creature takes <b>12d6 </b>radiant damage and is
            blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half
            as much damage and isn't blinded by this spell. Undead
            and o ozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

            A creature blinded by this spell makes another
            Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

            </p>
            <p>
            On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.

            This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was
            created by a spell.
