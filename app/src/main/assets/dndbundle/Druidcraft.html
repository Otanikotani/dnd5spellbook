            Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the
            following effects within range:
            • You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts
            what the weather will be at your location for the next
            24 hours. The effect might manifest as a golden orb
            for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes for
            snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round.

            </p>
            <p>
            • You instantly make a flower blossom, a seed pod open,
            or a leaf bud bloom.

            </p>
            <p>
            • You create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect,
            such as falling leaves, a puff of wind, the sound of a
            small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect
            must fit in a 5-foot cube.

            </p>
            <p>
            • You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a
            small campfire.
