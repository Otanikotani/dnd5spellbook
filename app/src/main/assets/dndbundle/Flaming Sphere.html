            A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an
            unoccupied space of your choice within range and lasts
            for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within 5
            feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            The creature takes <b>2d6 </b>fire damage on a failed save, or
            half as much damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30
            feet. If you ram the sphere into a creature, that creature
            must make the saving throw against the sphere's
            damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you move the sphere, you can direct it over
            barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to
            10 feet w ide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not
            being w orn or carried, and it sheds bright light in a
            20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d6 </b>for each slot level above 2nd.
