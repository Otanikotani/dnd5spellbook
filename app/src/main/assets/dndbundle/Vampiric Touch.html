            The touch of your shadow-wreathed hand can siphon life
            force from others to heal your w ounds. Make a melee
            spell attack against a creature within your reach. On
            a hit, the target takes <b>3d6 </b>necrotic damage, and you
            regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic
            damage dealt. Until the spell ends, you can make the
            attack again on each of your turns as an action.

            </p>

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d6 </b>for each slot level above 3rd.
