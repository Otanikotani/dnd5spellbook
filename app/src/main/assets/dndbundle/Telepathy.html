            You create a telepathic link between yourself and
            a willing creature with which you are familiar. The
            creature can be anywhere on the same plane of
            existence as you. The spell ends if you or the target are
            no longer on the same plane.

            </p>
            <p>
            Until the spell ends, you and the target can
            instantaneously share w ords, images, sounds, and
            other sensory messages with one another through the
            link, and the target recognizes you as the creature it
            is communicating with. The spell enables a creature
            with an Intelligence score of at least 1 to understand
            the meaning of your words and take in the scope of any
            sensory messages you send to it.
