            You touch a corpse or other remains. For the
            duration, the target is protected from decay and can't
            become undead.

            The spell also effectively extends the time limit on
            raising the target from the dead, since days spent under
            the influence of this spell don't count against the time
            limit of spells such as raise dead.
