            One creature or object of your choice that you can see
            within range rises vertically, up to 20 feet, and remains
            suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate
            a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling
            creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw
            is unaffected.

            </p>
            <p>
            The target can move only by pushing or pulling
            against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as
            a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it w ere
            climbing. You can change the target's altitude by up to
            20 feet in either direction on your turn. If you are the
            target, you can move up or down as part of your move.

            </p>
            <p>
            Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target,
            which must remain within the spell's range.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the
            ground if it is still aloft.
