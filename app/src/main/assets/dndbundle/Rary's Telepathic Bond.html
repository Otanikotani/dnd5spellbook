            You forge a telepathic link among up to eight w illing
            creatures of your choice within range, psychically

            Until the spell ends, the targets can communicate
            telepathically through the bond whether or not they have
            a common language. The communication is possible
            over any distance, though it can't extend to other planes
            of existence.
