            through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range.

            The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each
            creature in the area w ho sees the pattern must make
            a W isdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
            becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed
            by this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has
            a speed of 0.

            The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any
            damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the
            creature out of its stupor.
