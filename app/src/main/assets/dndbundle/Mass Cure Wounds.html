            A wave of healing energy washes out from a point of
            your choice within range. Choose up to six creatures
            in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each
            target regains hit points equal to <b>3d8 + </b>your spellcasting
            ability modifier. This spell has no effect on undead
            or constructs.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 6th level or higher, the healing increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 5th.
