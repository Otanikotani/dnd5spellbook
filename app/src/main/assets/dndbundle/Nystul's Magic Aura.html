            You place an illusion on a creature or an object
            you touch so that divination spells reveal false
            information about it. The target can be a willing
            creature or an object that isn't being carried or w orn by
            another creature.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast the spell, choose one or both of the
            following effects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you
            cast this spell on the same creature or object every day
            for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the
            illusion lasts until it is dispelled.

            False Aura. You change the way the target appears
            to spells and magical effects, such as detect magic,
            that detect magical auras. You can make a nonmagical
            object appear magical, a magical object appear
            nonmagical, or change the object's magical aura so that
            it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that
            you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you
            can make the false magic apparent to any creature that
            handles the item.

            Mask. You change the way the target appears to spells
            and magical effects that detect creature types, such as a
            paladin's Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            You choose a creature type and other spells and magical
            effects treat the target as if it w ere a creature of that
            type or of that alignment.
