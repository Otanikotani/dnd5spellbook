            The next time you hit a creature with a w eapon attack
            before this spell ends, a w rithing mass of thorny vines
            appears at the point of impact, and the target must
            succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by
            the magical vines until the spell ends. A Large or larger
            creature has advantage on this saving throw. If the
            target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away.

            </p>
            <p>
            While restrained by this spell, the target takes <b>1d6</b>
            piercing damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature
            restrained by the vines or one that can touch the creature
            can use its action to make a Strength check against your
            spell save DC. On a success, the target is freed.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell
            slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by <b>1d6</b>
            for each slot level above 1st.
