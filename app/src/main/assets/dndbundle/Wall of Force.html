            An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a
            point you choose within range. The wall appears in
            any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical
            barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting
            on a solid surface. You can form it into a hemispherical
            dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you
            can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-
            10-foot panels. Each panel must b e contiguous with
            another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4 inch thick.

            </p>
            <p>
            It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a
            creature's space when it appears, the creature is pushed
            to one side of the wall (your choice which side).

            </p>
            <p>
            Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is
            immune to all damage and can't be dispelled by dispel
            magic. A disintegrate spell destroys the wall instantly,
            however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane,
            blocking ethereal travel through the wall.
