            You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle
            enchantments at a creature you can see within range. If
            the target can hear you (though it need not understand
            you), it must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or take
            <b>1d4 </b>psychic damage and have disadvantage on the next
            attack roll it makes before the end of its next turn.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell's damage increases by <b>1d4 </b>when you reach
            5th level (<b>2d4</b>), 11th level (<b>3d4</b>), and 17th level (<b>4d4</b>).
