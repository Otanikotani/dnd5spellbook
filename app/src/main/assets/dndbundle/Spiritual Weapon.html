            You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that
            lasts for the duration or until you cast this spell again.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast the spell, you can make a melee spell
            attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On
            a hit, the target takes force damage equal to <b>1d8 + </b>your
            spellcasting ability modifier.

            </p>
            <p>
            As a bonus action on your turn, you can move the
            weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a
            creature within 5 feet of it.

            </p>
            <p>
            The weapon can take whatever form you choose.

            </p>
            <p>
            Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular
            weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known for his mace
            and Thor for his hammer) make this spell's effect
            resemble that weapon.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for every two slot levels above the 2nd.
