            You speak a w ord of power that can overwhelm the
            mind of one creature you can see within range, leaving
            it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or fewer,
            it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

            </p>
            <p>
            The stunned target must make a Constitution saving
            throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful
            save, this stunning effect ends.
