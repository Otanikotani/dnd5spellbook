            You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or
            humanoid that is within range for the entire casting
            time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially
            real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take
            actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature.

            </p>
            <p>
            It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half
            the creature's hit point maximum and is formed without
            any equipment. Otherwise, the illusion uses all the
            statistics of the creature it duplicates.

            </p>
            <p>
            The simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you
            designate. It obeys your spoken commands, moving
            and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting
            on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks the
            ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never
            increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain
            expended spell slots.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an
            alchemical laboratory, using rare herbs and minerals
            worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum
            lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it
            reverts to snow and melts instantly.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you cast this spell again, any currently
            active duplicates you created with this spell are
            instantly destroyed.
