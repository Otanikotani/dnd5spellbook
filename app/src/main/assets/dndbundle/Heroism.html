            Until the spell ends, the creature is immune to being
            frightened and gains temporary hit points equal to
            your spellcasting ability modifier at the start of each
            of its turns. When the spell ends, the target loses any
            remaining temporary hit points from this spell.

            </p>

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can target one
            additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
