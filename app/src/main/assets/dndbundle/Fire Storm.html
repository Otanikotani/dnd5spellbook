            A storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears
            in a location you choose within range. The area of the
            storm consists of up to ten 10-foot cubes, which you can
            arrange as you wish. Each cube must have at least one
            face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature
            in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It
            takes <b>7d10 </b>fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
            damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            The fire damages objects in the area and ignites
            flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you choose, plant life in the area is unaffected
            by this spell.
