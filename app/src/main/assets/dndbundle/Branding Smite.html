            The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack
            before this spell ends, the w eapon gleams with astral
            radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra <b>2d6</b>
            radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if
            it's invisible, and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot
            radius and can't become invisible until the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage
            increases by <b>1d6 </b>for each slot level above 2nd.
