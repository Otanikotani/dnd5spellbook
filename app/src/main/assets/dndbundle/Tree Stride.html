            You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside
            it to inside another tree of the same kind within 500
            feet. Both trees must be living and at least the same size
            as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree.

            </p>
            <p>
            You instantly know the location of all other trees of the
            same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the move used
            to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees
            or step out of the tree you're in. You appear in a spot of
            your choice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using
            another 5 feet of movement. If you have no movement
            left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can use this transportation ability once per round
            for the duration. You must end each turn outside a tree.
