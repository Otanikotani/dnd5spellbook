            You throw a nonmagical w eapon or fire a piece of
            nonmagical ammunition into the air to create a cone
            of identical weapons that shoot forward and then
            disappear. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed
            on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes <b>3d8</b>
            damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
            successful one. The damage type is the same as that of
            the w eapon or ammunition used as a component.
