            The first time you hit with a melee weapon attack
            during this spell's duration, your weapon rings with
            thunder that is audible within 300 feet of you, and the
            attack deals an extra <b>2d6 </b>thunder damage to the target.

            </p>
            <p>
            Additionally, if the target is a creature, it must succeed
            on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away
            from you and knocked prone.
