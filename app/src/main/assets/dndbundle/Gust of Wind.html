            A line of strong w ind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide
            blasts from you in a direction you choose for the spell's
            duration. Each creature that starts its turn in the line
            must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed
            15 feet away from you in a direction following the line.

            </p>
            <p>
            Any creature in the line must spend 2 feet of
            movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving
            closer to you.

            </p>
            <p>
            The gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes
            candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames in
            the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of
            lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to
            extinguish them.

            </p>
            <p>
            As a bonus action on each of your turns before the
            spell ends, you can change the direction in which the
            line blasts from you.
