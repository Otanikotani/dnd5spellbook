            A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips
            to a point of your choice within range, where it explodes
            in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the
            area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a
            failed save, a creature takes <b>10d6 </b>cold damage. On a
            successful save, it takes half as much damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is
            principally water (not including water-based creatures),
            it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches over an area
            30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures
            that w ere swimming on the surface of frozen water are
            trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action
            to make a Strength check against your spell save DC
            to break free.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can refrain from firing the globe after completing
            the spell, if you wish. A small globe about the size of
            a sling stone, co o l to the touch, appears in your hand.

            </p>
            <p>
            At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to
            can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it
            with a sling (to the sling's normal range). It shatters
            on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting
            of the spell. You can also set the globe down without
            shattering it. After 1 minute, if the globe hasn't already
            shattered, it explodes.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d6 </b>for each slot level above 6th.
