            You choose one object that you must touch throughout
            the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some
            other magic-imbued object, you learn its properties
            and how to use them, whether it requires attunement
            to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn
            whether any spells are affecting the item and what they
            are. If the item w as created by a spell, you learn which
            spell created it.

            </p>

            If you instead touch a creature throughout the casting,
            you learn what spells, if any, are currently affecting it.
