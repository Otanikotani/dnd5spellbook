            You summon elementals that appear in unoccupied
            spaces that you can see within range. You choose one
            the following options for what appears:
            • One elemental of challenge rating 2 or lower
            • Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or lower
            • Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
            • Eight elementals of challenge rating 1/4 or lower.

            </p>
            <p>
            An elemental summoned by this spell disappears when
            it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

            The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your
            companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures
            as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any
            verbal commands that you issue to them (no action
            required by you). If you don't issue any commands to
            them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures,
            but otherwise take no actions.

            </p>
            <p>
            The DM has the creatures' statistics.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the
            summoning options above, and more creatures appear:
            twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as
            many with an 8th-level slot.
