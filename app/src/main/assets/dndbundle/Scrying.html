            You can see and hear a particular creature you choose
            that is on the same plane of existence as you. The target
            must make a W isdom saving throw, which is modified
            by how well you know the target and the sort of physical
            connection you have to it. If a target knows you're
            casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily
            if it wants to be observed.

            </p>
            <p>
            Knowledge Save Modifier
            Secondhand (you have heard of the target) +5
            Firsthand (you have met the target) +0
            Familiar (you know the target well) -5
            Connection Save Modifier
            Likeness or picture -2
            Possession or garment -4
            Body part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like -10
            On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you
            can't use this spell against it again for 24 hours.

            </p>
            <p>
            On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible sensor
            within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through
            the sensor as if you w ere there. The sensor moves with
            the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor
            as a luminous orb about the size of your fist.

            </p>
            <p>
            Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a
            location you have seen before as the target of this spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you do, the sensor appears at that location and
            doesn't move.
