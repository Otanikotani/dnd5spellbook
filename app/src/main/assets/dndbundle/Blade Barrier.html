            You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades
            made of magical energy. The wall appears within range
            and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight wall
            up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a
            ringed wall up to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and
            5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters cover to
            creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain.

            When a creature enters the w all's area for the first
            time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must
            make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the
            creature takes 6 d10 slashing damage. On a successful
            save, the creature takes half as much damage.
