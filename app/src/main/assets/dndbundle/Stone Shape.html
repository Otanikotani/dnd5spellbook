            You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or
            a section of stone no more than 5 feet in any dimension
            and form it into any shape that suits your purpose. So,
            for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon,
            idol, or coffer, or make a small passage through a wall,
            as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You could
            also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door
            shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges
            and a latch, but finer mechanical detail isn't possible.
