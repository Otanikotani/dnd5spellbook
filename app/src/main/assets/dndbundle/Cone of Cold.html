            A blast of cold air erupts from your hands. Each
            creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution
            saving throw. A creature takes <b>8d8 </b>cold damage on a
            failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            A creature killed by this spell becomes a frozen statue
            until it thaws.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 5th.
