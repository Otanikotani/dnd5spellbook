            A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward
            a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of
            lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged
            spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target
            takes <b>1d12 </b>lightning damage, and on each of your turns
            for the duration, you can use your action to deal <b>1d12</b>
            lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell
            ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell
            also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or
            if it has total cover from you.

            </p>

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage
            increases by <b>1d12 </b>for each slot level above 1st.
