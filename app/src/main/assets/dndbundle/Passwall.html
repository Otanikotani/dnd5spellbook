            A passage appears at a point of your choice that you
            can see on a w ooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as
            a wall, a ceiling, or a floor) within range, and lasts for
            the duration. You choose the opening's dimensions: up
            to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet deep. The passage
            creates no instability in a structure surrounding it.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the opening disappears, any creatures or
            objects still in the passage created by the spell are safely
            ejected to an unoccupied space nearest to the surface on
            which you cast the spell.
