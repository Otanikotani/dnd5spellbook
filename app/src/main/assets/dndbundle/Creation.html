            You pull w isps of shadow material from the Shadowfell
            to create a nonliving object of vegetable matter within
            range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something similar. You
            can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as
            stone, crystal, or metal. The object created must be no
            larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a
            form and material that you have seen before.

            </p>
            <p>
            The duration depends on the object's material. If
            the object is composed of multiple materials, use the
            shortest duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            Using any material created by this spell as another
            spell's material component causes that spell tofail.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 6th level or higher, the cube increases by 5
            feet for each slot level above 5th.
