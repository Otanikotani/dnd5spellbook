            Divine energy radiates from you, distorting and
            diffusing m agical energy within 30 feet of you. Until
            the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on
            you. For the duration, each friendly creature in the area
            (including you) has advantage on saving throws against
            spells and other magical effects. Additionally, when
            an affected creature succeeds on a saving throw made
            against a spell or magical effect that allows it to make a
            saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes
            no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw.
