            Until the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a
            20-foot-tall cylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on
            a point you choose within range. The area is heavily
            obscured, and exposed flames in the area are doused.

            </p>
            <p>
            The ground in the area is covered with slick ice,
            making it difficult terrain. When a creature enters the
            spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn
            there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
            save, it falls prone.

            </p>
            <p>
            If a creature is concentrating in the spell's area, the
            creature must make a successful Constitution saving
            throw against your spell save DC or lose concentration.
