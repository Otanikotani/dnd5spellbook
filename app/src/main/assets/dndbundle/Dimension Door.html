            You teleport yourself from your current location to any
            other spot within range. You arrive at exactly the spot
            desired. It can be a place you can see, one you can
            visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance
            and direction, such as “ 200 feet straight downward” or
            “upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300 feet.”
            You can bring along objects as long as their weight
            doesn't exceed what you can carry. You can also bring
            one willing creature of your size or smaller w ho is
            carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature
            must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.
