            You summon fey creatures that appear in unoccupied
            spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the
            following options for what appears:
            • One fey creature of challenge rating 2 or lower
            • Twofey creatures of challenge rating 1 or lower
            • Four fey creatures of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
            • Eight fey creatures of challenge rating 1/4 or lower
            A summoned creature disappears when it drops to 0 hit
            points or when the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your
            companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures
            as a group, which have their own turns. They obey any
            verbal commands that you issue to them (no action
            required by you). If you don't issue any commands to
            them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures,
            but otherwise take no actions.

            </p>
            <p>
            The DM has the creatures' statistics.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the
            summoning options above, and more creatures appear:
            twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as
            many with an 8th-level slot.
