            Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on
            ground that you can see within range. For the duration,
            these tentacles turn the ground in the area into
            difficult terrain.

            </p>
            <p>
            When a creature enters the affected area for the first
            time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature
            must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take <b>3d6</b>
            bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles
            until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the
            area and is already restrained by the tentacles takes <b>3d6</b>
            bludgeoning damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature restrained by the tentacles can use its
            action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice)
            against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
