            You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally
            communicate with beasts for the duration. The
            knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited
            by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can
            give you information about nearby locations and
            monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have
            perceived within the past day. You might be able to
            persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the
            DM's discretion.
