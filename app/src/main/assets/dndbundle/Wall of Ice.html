            You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere
            with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape a flat
            surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each
            panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any
            form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the wall cuts through a creature's space when it
            appears, the creature within its area is pushed to one
            side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            On a failed save, the creature takes <b>10d6 </b>cold damage,
            or half as much damage on a successful save.

            </p>
            <p>
            The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus
            breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot
            section, and it is vulnerable tofire damage. Reducing
            a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it and
            leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall
            occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid
            air for the first time on a turn must make a Constitution
            saving throw. That creature takes <b>5d6 </b>cold damage on a
            failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall
            deals when it appears increases by <b>2d6</b>, and the damage
            from passing through the sheet of frigid air increases by
            <b>1d6</b>, for each slot level above 6th.
