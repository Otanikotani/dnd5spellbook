            An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into
            existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for
            the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            Any spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the
            barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even
            if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a
            spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier,
            but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area
            within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected
            by such spells.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells
            of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.
