            As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and
            fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from
            your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot
            cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature
            takes <b>3d6 </b>fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
            damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that
            aren't being w orn or carried.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d6 </b>for each slot level above 1st.
