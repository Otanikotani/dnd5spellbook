            You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five
            wasps, or one scorpion within range into giant versions
            of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede
            becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant
            spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion
            becomes a giant scorpion.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each creature obeys your verbal commands, and
            in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM
            has the statistics for these creatures and resolves their
            actions and movement.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature remains in its giant size for the duration,
            until it drops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to
            dismiss the effect on it.

            </p>
            <p>
            The DM might allow you to choose different targets.

            </p>
            <p>
            For example, if you transform a bee, its giant version
            might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.
