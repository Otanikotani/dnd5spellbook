            You sense the presence of any trap within range that
            is within line of sight. A trap, for the purpose of this
            spell, includes anything that w ould inflict a sudden or
            unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable,
            which w as specifically intended as such by its creator.

            Thus, the spell w ould sense an area affected by the
            alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap,
            but it w ould not reveal a natural weakness in the floor,
            an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You
            don't learn the location of each trap, but you do learn the
            general nature of the danger posed by a trap you sense.
