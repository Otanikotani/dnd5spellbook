            The next time you make a ranged w eapon attack during
            the spell's duration, the weapon's ammunition, or the
            weapon itself if it's a thrown weapon, transforms into
            a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The
            target takes <b>4d8 </b>lightning damage on a hit, or half
            as much damage on a miss, instead of the weapon's
            normal damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            Whether you hit or miss, each creature within 10 feet
            of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each
            of these creatures takes <b>2d8 </b>lightning damage on a
            failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to
            its normal form.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage for both
            effects of the spell increases by <b>1d8 </b>for each slot
            level above 3rd.
