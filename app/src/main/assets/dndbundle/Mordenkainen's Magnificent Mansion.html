            You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range
            that lasts for the duration. You choose where its one
            entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly
            and is 5 feet w ide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature
            you designate when you cast the spell can enter the
            extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal remains
            open. You can open or close the portal if you are within
            30 feet of it. While closed, the portal is invisible.

            </p>

            Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with
            numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean,
            fresh, and warm.

            You can create any floor plan you like, but the space
            can't exceed 50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on
            each side. The place is furnished and decorated as
            you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a ninecourse
            banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100
            near-transparent servants attends all who enter. You
