            <p>
            Until the spell ends, one willing creature you
            touch is protected against certain types of
            creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey,
            fiends, and undead.

            </p>
            <p>
            The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of
            those types have disadvantage on attack rolls against
            the target. The target also can't be charmed, frightened,
            or p os sessed by them. If the target is already charmed,
            frightened, or p ossessed by such a creature, the target
            has advantage on any new saving throw against the
            relevant effect.
