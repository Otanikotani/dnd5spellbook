            You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see
            within range and create an illusory manifestation of its
            deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target
            must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
            the target b ecomes frightened for the duration. At the
            start of each of the target's turns before the spell ends,
            the target must succeed on a W isdom saving throw
            or take 4 d10 psychic damage. On a successful save,
            the spell ends.
