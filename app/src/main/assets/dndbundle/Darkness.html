            Magical darkness spreads from a point you choose
            within range tofill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the
            duration. The darkness spreads around corners.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature with darkvision can't see through this
            darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the point you choose is on an object you are holding
            or one that isn't being w orn or carried, the darkness
            emanates from the object and moves with it. Completely
            covering the source of the darkness with an opaque
            object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the darkness.

            </p>
            <p>
            If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of light
            created by a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that
            created the light is dispelled.
