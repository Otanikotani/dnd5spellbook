            Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your
            choice that you can see within range, draining moisture
            and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution
            saving throw. The target takes <b>8d8 </b>necrotic damage on
            a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
            one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it
            makes the saving throw with disadvantage, and the spell
            deals maximum damage to it.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you target a nonmagical plant that isn't a creature,
            such as a tree or shrub, it doesn't make a saving throw;
            it simply withers and dies.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 4th.
