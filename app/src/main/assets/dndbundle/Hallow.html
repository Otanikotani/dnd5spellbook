            <p>
            You touch a point and infuse an area around it with holy
            (or unholy) power. The area can have a radius up to 60
            feet, and the spell fails if the radius includes an area
            already under the effect a hallow spell. The affected area
            is subject to the following effects.

            </p>
            <p>
            First, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead
            can't enter the area, nor can such creatures charm,
            frighten, or p os sess creatures within it. Any creature
            charmed, frightened, or pos sessed by such a creature
            is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed upon
            entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those
            types of creatures from this effect.

            </p>
            <p>
            Second, you can bind an extra effect to the area.

            </p>
            <p>
            Choose the effect from the following list, or choose an
            effect offered by the DM. Some of these effects apply to
            creatures in the area; you can designate whether the
            effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a
            specific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort,
            such as ores or trolls. When a creature that would be
            affected enters the spell's area for the first time on a
            turn or starts its turn there, it can make a Charisma
            saving throw. On a success, the creature ignores the
            extra effect until it leaves the area.

            </p>
            <p>
            Courage. Affected creatures can't be frightened
            while in the area.

            </p>
            <p>
            Darkness. Darkness fills the area. Normal light,
            as well as magical light created by spells of a lower
            level than the slot you used to cast this spell, can't
            illuminate the area.

            </p>
            <p>
            Daylight. Bright light fills the area. Magical darkness
            created by spells of a lower level than the slot you used
            to cast this spell can't extinguish the light.

            </p>
            <p>
            Energy Protection. Affected creatures in the area
            have resistance to one damage type of your choice,
            except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

            </p>
            <p>
            Energy Vulnerability. Affected creatures in the area
            have vulnerability to one damage type of your choice,
            except for bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing.

            </p>
            <p>
            Everlasting Rest. Dead bodies interred in the area
            can't be turned into undead.

            </p>
            <p>
            Extradimensional Interference. Affected creatures
            can't move or travel using teleportation or by
            extradimensional or interplanar means.

            </p>
            <p>
            Fear. Affected creatures are frightened
            while in the area.

            </p>
            <p>
            Silence. No sound can emanate from within the area,
            and no sound can reach into it.

            </p>
            <p>
            Tongues. Affected creatures can communicate with
            any other creature in the area, even if they don't share a
            common language.

            </p>
