            Blazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four
            different points you can see within range. Each creature
            in a 40-foot-radius sphere centered on each point you
            choose must make a Dexterity saving throw. The sphere
            spreads around corners. A creature takes <b>20d6 </b>fire
            damage and <b>20d6 </b>bludgeoning damage on a failed
            save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A
            creature in the area of more than one fiery burst is
            affected only once.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell damages objects in the area and ignites
            flammable objects that aren't being worn or carried.
