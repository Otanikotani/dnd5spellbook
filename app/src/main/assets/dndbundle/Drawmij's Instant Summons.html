            You touch an object weighing 10 pounds or less w hose
            longest dimension is 6 feet or less. The spell leaves an
            invisible mark on its surface and invisibly inscribes the
            name of the item on the sapphire you use as the material
            component. Each time you cast this spell, you must use
            a different sapphire.

            </p>
            <p>
            At any time thereafter, you can use your action to
            speak the item's name and crush the sapphire. The item
            instantly appears in your hand regardless of physical or
            planar distances, and the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            If another creature is holding or carrying the item,
            crushing the sapphire doesn't transport the item to you,
            but instead you learn who the creature possessing the
            object is and roughly where that creature is located
            at that moment.

            </p>
            <p>
            Dispel magic or a similar effect successfully applied to
            the sapphire ends this spell's effect.
