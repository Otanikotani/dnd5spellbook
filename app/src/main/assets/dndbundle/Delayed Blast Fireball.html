            A beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger,
            then condenses to linger at a chosen point within range
            as a glowing bead for the duration. When the spell
            ends, either because your concentration is broken or
            because you decide to end it, the bead blossoms with a
            low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads around
            corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere
            centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving
            throw. A creature takes fire damage equal to the total
            accumulated damage on a failed save, or half as much
            damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell's base damage is <b>12d6</b>. If at the end of
            your turn the bead has not yet detonated, the damage
            increases by <b>1d6</b>.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the glowing bead is touched before the interval
            has expired, the creature touching it must make a
            Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the spell ends
            immediately, causing the bead to erupt in flame. On a
            successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to
            40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the
            spell ends, and the bead explodes.

            </p>
            <p>
            The fire damages objects in the area and ignites
            flammable objects that aren't being w orn or carried.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the base damage
            increases by <b>1d6 </b>for each slot level above 7th.
