            You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush
            bristling with needle-sharp thorns. The wall appears
            within range on a solid surface and lasts for the
            duration. You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet
            long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has
            a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet
            thick. The wall blocks line of sight.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the wall appears, each creature within its area
            must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save,
            a creature takes <b>7d8 </b>piercing damage, or half as much
            damage on a successful save.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly
            and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature moves
            through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement.

            </p>
            <p>
            Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the wall
            on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must
            make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes <b>7d8 </b>slashing
            damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
            successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 7th level or higher, both types of damage
            increase by <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 6th.
