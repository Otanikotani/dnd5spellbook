            You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is
            similar in size and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for
            the duration. If you let go of the blade, it disappears, but
            you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can use your action to make a melee spell
            attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the target takes
            <b>3d6 </b>fire damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot
            radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

            </p>

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d6 </b>for every two slot levels above 2nd.
