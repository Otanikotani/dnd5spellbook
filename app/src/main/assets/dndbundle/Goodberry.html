            Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused
            with magic for the duration. A creature can use its
            action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit
            point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to
            sustain a creature for one day.

            </p>
            <p>
            The berries lose their potency if they have not been
            consumed within 24 hours of the casting of this spell.
