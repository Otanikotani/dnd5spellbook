            A flood of healing energy flows from you into injured
            creatures around you. You restore up to 700 hit points,
            divided as you choose among any number of creatures
            that you can see within range. Creatures healed by
            this spell are also cured of all diseases and any effect
            making them blinded or deafened. This spell has no
            effect on undead or constructs.
