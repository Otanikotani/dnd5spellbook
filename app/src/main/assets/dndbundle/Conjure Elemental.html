            You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air,
            earth, fire, or water that fills a 10-foot cube within range.

            </p>
            <p>
            An elemental of challenge rating 5 or lower appropriate
            to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space
            within 10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental
            emerges from a bonfire, and an earth elemental rises
            up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it
            drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            The elemental is friendly to you and your companions
            for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which
            has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that
            you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't
            issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself
            from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions.

            </p>
            <p>
            If your concentration is broken, the elemental doesn't
            disappear. Instead, you lose control of the elemental,
            it becomes hostile toward you and your companions,
            and it might attack. An uncontrolled elemental can't
            be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after
            you summoned it.

            </p>
            <p>
            The DM has the elemental's statistics.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the challenge rating
            increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.

            d10 Behavior
            1 The creature uses all its movement to move in a
            random direction. To determine the direction, roll
            a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The
            creature doesn't take an action this turn.

            </p>
            <p>
            2-6 The creature doesn't move or take actions this turn.

            </p>
            <p>
            7-8 The creature uses its action to make a melee attack
            against a randomly determined creature within its
            reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the
            creature does nothing this turn.

            </p>
            <p>
            9-10 The creature can act and move normally.
