            You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group
            of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere
            centered on a point you choose within range must make
            a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to
            fail this saving throw if it w ishes. If a creature fails its
            saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.

            You can suppress any effect causing a target to be
            charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any
            suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration
            has not expired in the meantime.

            </p>
            <p>
            Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about
            creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This
            indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by
            a spell or if it w itnesses any of its friends being harmed.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile
            again, unless the DM rules otherwise.
