            You create a ward against magical travel that protects
            up to 40,000 square feet of floor space to a height of 30
            feet above the floor. For the duration, creatures can't
            teleport into the area or use portals, such as those
            created by the gate spell, to enter the area. The spell
            proofs the area against planar travel, and therefore
            prevents creatures from accessing the area by way of
            the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell,
            or the plane shift spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            In addition, the spell damages types of creatures that
            you choose when you cast it. Choose one or more of the
            following: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.

            </p>
            <p>
            When a chosen creature enters the spell's area for the
            first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature
            takes <b>5d10 </b>radiant or necrotic damage (your choice
            when you cast this spell).

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast this spell, you can designate a
            password. A creature that speaks the password as it
            enters the area takes no damage from the spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell's area can't overlap with the area of another
            forbiddance spell. If you cast forbiddance every day for
            30 days in the same location, the spell lasts until it is
            dispelled, and the material components are consumed
            on the last casting.
