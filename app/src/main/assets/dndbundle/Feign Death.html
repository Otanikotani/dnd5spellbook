            <p>
            You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic
            state that is indistinguishable from death.

            </p>
            <p>
            For the spell's duration, or until you use an action
            to touch the target and dismiss the spell, the target
            appears dead to all outward inspection and to spells
            used to determine the target's status. The target is
            blinded and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0.

            </p>
            <p>
            The target has resistance to all damage except psychic
            damage. If the target is diseased or poisoned when you
            cast the spell, or b ecomes diseased or poisoned while
            under the spell's effect, the disease and poison have no
            effect until the spell ends.
