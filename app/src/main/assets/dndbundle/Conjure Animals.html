            You summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and
            appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within
            range. Choose one of the following options for what
            appears:
            • One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower
            • Two beasts of challenge rating 1 or lower
            • Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or lower
            • Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower
            Each beast is also considered fey, and it disappears
            when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

            The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your
            companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures
            as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any
            verbal commands that you issue to them (no action
            required by you). If you don't issue any commands to
            them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures,
            but otherwise take no actions.

            </p>

            The DM has the creatures' statistics.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            certain higher-level spell slots, you choose one of the
            summoning options above, and more creatures appear:
            twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many
            with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a
            9th-level slot.
