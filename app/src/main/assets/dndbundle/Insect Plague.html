            Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere
            centered on a point you choose within range. The sphere
            spreads around corners. The sphere remains for the
            duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere's
            area is difficult terrain.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the area appears, each creature in it must
            make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes
            4 d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much
            damage on a successful one. A creature must also make
            this saving throw when it enters the spell's area for the
            first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d10 </b>for each slot level above 5th.
