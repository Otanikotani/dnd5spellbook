            This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature
            as a safeguard against death. This clone forms inside
            a sealed vessel and grows tofull size and maturity
            after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone
            be a younger version of the same creature. It remains
            inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel
            remains undisturbed.

            </p>
            <p>
            At any time after the clone matures, if the original
            creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided
            that the soul is free and w illing to return. The clone is
            physically identical to the original and has the same
            personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the
            original's equipment. The original creature's physical
            remains, if they still exist, become inert and can't
            thereafter be restored to life, since the creature's soul
            is elsewhere.
