            You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you
            to a distance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good
            or neutral, their spectral form appears angelic or fey
            (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast this spell, you can designate any
            number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it.

            </p>
            <p>
            An affected creature's speed is halved in the area, and
            when the creature enters the area for the first time on
            a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom
            saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes <b>3d8</b>
            radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or <b>3d8</b>
            necrotic damage (if you are evil). On a successful save,
            the creature takes half as much damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 3rd.
