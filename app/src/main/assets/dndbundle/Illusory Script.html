            You write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable
            writing material and imbue it with a potent illusion that
            lasts for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            To you and any creatures you designate when you
            cast the spell, the writing appears normal, written in
            your hand, and conveys whatever meaning you intended
            when you wrote the text. To all others, the writing
            appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical
            script that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause
            the writing to appear to be an entirely different message,
            written in a different hand and language, though the
            language must be one you know.

            </p>
            <p>
            Should the spell be dispelled, the original script and
            the illusion both disappear.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature with truesight can read the
            hidden message.
