            Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the
            duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and
            dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell
            early by using an action to dismiss it.

            The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill
            shield, as you choose. The w arm shield grants you
            resistance to cold damage, and the chill shield grants
            you resistance tofire damage.

            In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you
            hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with
            flame. The attacker takes <b>2d8 </b>fire damage from a warm
            shield, or <b>2d8 </b>cold damage from a cold shield.
