            You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any
            dimension. Until the spell ends, the object sheds bright
            light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional
            20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely
            covering the object with something opaque blocks the
            light. The spell ends if you cast it again or dismiss it
            as an action.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you target an object held or worn by a hostile
            creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity
            saving throw to avoid the spell.
