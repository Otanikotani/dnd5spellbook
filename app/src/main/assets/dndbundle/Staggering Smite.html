            The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon
            attack during this spell's duration, your w eapon pierces
            both body and mind, and the attack deals an extra
            <b>4d6 </b>psychic damage to the target. The target must
            make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it has
            disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks, and
            can't take reactions, until the end of its next turn.
