            You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the
            ground that you can see within range. For the duration,
            an intense tremor rips through the ground in a
            100-foot-radius circle centered on that point and shakes
            creatures and structures in contact with the ground
            in that area.

            </p>
            <p>
            The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must
            make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the
            creature's concentration is broken.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast this spell and at the end of each turn
            you spend concentrating on it, each creature on the
            ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            On a failed save, the creature is knocked prone.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell can have additional effects depending on
            the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM.

            </p>
            <p>
            Fissures. Fissures open throughout the spell's area at
            the start of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total
            of <b>1d6 </b>such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each is <b>1d10 </b>x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends
            from one edge of the spell's area to the opposite side.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens
            must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A
            creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure's
            edge as it opens.

            </p>
            <p>
            A fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to
            automatically collapse (see below).

            </p>
            <p>
            Structures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage
            to any structure in contact with the ground in the area
            when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your
            turns until the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit
            points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby
            creatures. A creature within half the distance of a
            structure's height must make a Dexterity saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            On a failed save, the creature takes <b>5d6 </b>bludgeoning
            damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble,
            requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an
            action to escape. The DM can adjust the DC higher
            or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On
            a successful save, the creature takes half as much
            damage and doesn't fall prone or become buried.
