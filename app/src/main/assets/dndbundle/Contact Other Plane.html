            You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead
            sage, or some other mysterious entity from another
            plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence can
            strain or even break your mind. When you cast this
            spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a
            failure, you take <b>6d6 </b>psychic damage and are insane
            until you finish a long rest. While insane, you can't take
            actions, can't understand what other creatures say, can't
            read, and speak only in gibberish. A greater restoration
            spell cast on you ends this effect.

            </p>

            On a successful save, you can ask the entity up tofive
            questions. You must ask your questions before the spell
            ends. The DM answers each question with one word,
            such as “yes,” “no,” “maybe,” “never,” “irrelevant,” or
            “unclear” (if the entity doesn't know the answer to the
            question). If a one-word answer w ould be misleading,
            the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer.
