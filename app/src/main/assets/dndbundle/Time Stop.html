            You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but
            yourself. No time passes for other creatures, while you
            take <b>1d4 + 1</b> turns in a row, during which you can use
            actions and move as normal.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell ends if one of the actions you use during
            this period, or any effects that you create during this
            period, affects a creature other than you or an object
            being worn or carried by someone other than you. In
            addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than
            1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.
