            You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you
            for the duration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            Moving to a place where you don't have a clear path to
            the sky ends the spell early.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast the spell, you change the current
            weather conditions, which are determined by the DM
            based on the climate and season. You can change
            precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes <b>1d4 </b>x 10
            minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they
            do so, you can change the conditions again. When the
            spell ends, the weather gradually returns to normal.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you change the weather conditions, find a
            current condition on the following tables and change its
            stage by one, up or down. When changing the wind, you
            can change its direction.
