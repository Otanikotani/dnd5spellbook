            Choose one creature that you can see within range. The
            target begins a comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping
            its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures that
            can't be charmed are immune to this spell.

            </p>

            A dancing creature must use all its movement to
            dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage
            on Dexterity saving throws and attack rolls. While
            the target is affected by this spell, other creatures
            have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an
            action, a dancing creature makes a W isdom saving
            throw to regain control of itself. On a successful save,
            the spell ends.
