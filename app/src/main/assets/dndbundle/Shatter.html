            A sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts
            from a point of your choice within range. Each creature
            in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must
            make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes
            <b>3d8 </b>thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much
            damage on a successful one. A creature made of
            inorganic material such as stone, crystal, or metal has
            disadvantage on this saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried
            also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 2nd.
