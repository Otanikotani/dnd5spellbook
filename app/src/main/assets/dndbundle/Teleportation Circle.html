            As you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter
            circle on the ground inscribed with sigils that link
            your location to a permanent teleportation circle of
            your choice w hose sigil sequence you know and that is
            on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering
            portal opens within the circle you drew and remains
            open until the end of your next turn. Any creature that
            enters the portal instantly appears within 5 feet of the
            destination circle or in the nearest unoccupied space if
            that space is occupied.

            Many m ajor temples, guilds, and other important
            places have permanent teleportation circles inscribed
            somewhere within their confines. Each such circle
            includes a unique sigil sequenceâ€”a string of magical
            runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you first
            gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil
            sequences for two destinations on the Material Plane,
            determined by the DM. You can learn additional sigil
            sequences during your adventures. You can commit
            a new sigil sequence to memory after studying it
            for 1 minute.

            You can create a permanent teleportation circle by
            casting this spell in the same location every day for one
            year. You need not use the circle to teleport when you
            cast the spell in this way.
