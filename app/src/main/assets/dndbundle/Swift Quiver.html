            You transmute your quiver so it produces an endless
            supply of nonmagical ammunition, which seems to leap
            into your hand when you reach for it.

            </p>
            <p>
            On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use
            a bonus action to make two attacks with a weapon that
            uses ammunition from the quiver. Each time you make
            such a ranged attack, your quiver magically replaces
            the piece of ammunition you used with a similar piece
            of nonmagical ammunition. Any pieces of ammunition
            created by this spell disintegrate when the spell ends. If
            the quiver leaves your possession, the spell ends.
