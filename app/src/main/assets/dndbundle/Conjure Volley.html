            You fire a p iece of nonmagical ammunition from a
            ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical w eapon into
            the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds of
            duplicates of the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley
            from above and then disappear. Each creature in a
            40-foot-radius. 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that
            point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature
            takes <b>8d8 </b>damage on a failed save, or half as much
            damage on a successful one. The damage type is the
            same as that of the ammunition or weapon.
