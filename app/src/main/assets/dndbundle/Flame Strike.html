            A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the
            heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in
            a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on a
            point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature takes <b>4d6 </b>fire damage and <b>4d6 </b>radiant
            damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
            successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the
            radiant damage (your choice) increases by <b>1d6 </b>for each
            slot level above 5th.
