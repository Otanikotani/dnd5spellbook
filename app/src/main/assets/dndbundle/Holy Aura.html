            Divine light washes out from you and coalesces
            in a soft radiance in a 30-foot radius around you.

            </p>
            <p>
            Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast
            this spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have
            advantage on all saving throws, and other creatures
            have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until
            the spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an undead
            hits an affected creature with a melee attack, the aura
            flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must succeed
            on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until
            the spell ends.
