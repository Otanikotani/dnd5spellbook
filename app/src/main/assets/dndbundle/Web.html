            You conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of
            your choice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube
            from that point for the duration. The w ebs are difficult
            terrain and lightly obscure their area.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the w ebs aren't anchored between two solid masses
            (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall,
            or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the
            spell ends at the start of your next turn. W ebs layered
            over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that
            enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity
            saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained
            as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature restrained by the w ebs can use its action to
            make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it
            succeeds, it is no longer restrained.

            </p>
            <p>
            The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs
            exposed tofire burns away in 1 round, dealing <b>2d4 </b>fire
            damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.
