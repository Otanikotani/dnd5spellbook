            A 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point
            you choose within range. The sphere is bright light and
            sheds dim light for an additional 60 feet.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you chose a point on an object you are holding or
            one that isn't being w orn or carried, the light shines
            from the object and moves with it. Completely covering
            the affected object with an opaque object, such as a bowl
            or a helm, blocks the light.

            </p>
            <p>
            If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of
            darkness created by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the
            spell that created the darkness is dispelled.
