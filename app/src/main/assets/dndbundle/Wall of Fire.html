            You create a wall of fire on a solid surface within
            range. You can make the wall up to 60 feet long, 20
            feet high, and 1 foot thick, or a ringed wall up to 20 feet
            in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick. The wall is
            opaque and lasts for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the wall appears, each creature within its area
            must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a
            creature takes <b>5d8 </b>fire damage, or half as much damage
            on a successful save.

            </p>
            <p>
            One side of the wall, selected by you when you cast
            this spell, deals <b>5d8 </b>fire damage to each creature that
            ends its turn within 10 feet of that side or inside the
            wall. A creature takes the same damage when it enters
            the wall for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

            </p>
            <p>
            The other side of the wall deals no damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 5th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 4th.
