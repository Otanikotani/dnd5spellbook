            <p>
            You send a short message of twenty-five words or
            less to a creature with which you are familiar. The
            creature hears the message in its mind, recognizes
            you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer in a
            like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures
            with Intelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the
            meaning of your message.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can send the message across any distance and
            even to other planes of existence, but if the target is on a
            different plane than you, there is a 5 percent chance that
            the message doesn't arrive.
