            Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to
            all w ho can see you. For the duration, any creature has
            disadvantage on attack rolls against you. An attacker
            is immune to this effect if it doesn't rely on sight,
            as with blindsight, or can see through illusions, as
            with truesight.
