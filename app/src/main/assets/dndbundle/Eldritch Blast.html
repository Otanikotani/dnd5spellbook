            A beam of crackling energy streaks toward a creature
            within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the
            target. On a hit, the target takes 1dlO force damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell creates more than one beam when you reach
            higher levels: two beams at 5th level, three beams at
            11th level, and four beams at 17th level. You can direct
            the beams at the same target or at different ones. Make
            a separate attack roll for each beam.
