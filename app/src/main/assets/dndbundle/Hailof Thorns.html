            The next time you hit a creature with a ranged weapon
            attack before the spell ends, this spell creates a rain
            of thorns that sprouts from your ranged w eapon or
            ammunition. In addition to the normal effect of the
            attack, the target of the attack and each creature within
            5 feet of it must make a Dexterity saving throw. A
            creature takes 1dlO piercing damage on a failed save, or
            half as much damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell
            slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by <b>1d10</b>
            for each slot level above 1st (to a maximum of 6 d10).
