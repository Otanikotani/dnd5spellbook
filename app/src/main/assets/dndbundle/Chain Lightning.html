            You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of
            your choice that you can see within range. Three bolts
            then leap from that target to as many as three other
            targets, each of which must b e within 30 feet of the first
            target. A target can be a creature or an object and can
            be targeted by only one of the bolts.

            </p>
            <p>
            A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The
            target takes <b>10d8 </b>lightning damage on a failed save, or
            half as much damage on a successful one.

            </p>

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 7th level or higher, one additional bolt
            leaps from the first target to another target for each slot
            level above 6th.
