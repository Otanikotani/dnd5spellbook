            Choose a creature that you can see within range. The
            target must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or be
            paralyzed for the duration. This spell has no effect on
            undead. At the end of each of its turns, the target can
            make another Wisdom saving throw. On a success, the
            spell ends on the target.
