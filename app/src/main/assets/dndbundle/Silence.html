            For the duration, no sound can be created within or
            pass through a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a
            point you choose within range. Any creature or object
            entirely inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage,
            and creatures are deafened while entirely inside it.

            </p>
            <p>
            Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is
            impossible there.
