            Creatures of your choice that you can see within range
            and that can hear you must make a W isdom saving
            throw. A target automatically succeeds on this saving
            throw if it can't be charmed. On a failed save, a target
            is affected by this spell. Until the spell ends, you can
            use a bonus action on each of your turns to designate a
            direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target
            must u se as much of its movement as possible to move
            in that direction on its next turn. It can take its action
            before it moves. After moving in this way, it can make
            another Wisdom saving to try to end the effect.

            </p>

            A target isn't compelled to move into an obviously
            deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it w ill provoke
            opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction.
