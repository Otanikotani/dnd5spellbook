            The next time you hit with a melee w eapon attack
            during this spell's duration, your attack deals an extra
            <b>1d6 </b>psychic damage. Additionally, if the target is a
            creature, it must make a W isdom saving throw or be
            frightened of you until the spell ends. As an action, the
            creature can make a W isdom check against your spell
            save DC to steel its resolve and end this spell.
