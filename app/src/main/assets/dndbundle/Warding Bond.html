            This spell wards a willing creature you touch and
            creates a mystic connection between you and the target
            until the spell ends. While the target is within 60 feet of
            you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and
            it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time it takes
            damage, you take the same amount of damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you
            and the target become separated by more than 60 feet.

            </p>
            <p>
            It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the
            connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell
            as an action.
