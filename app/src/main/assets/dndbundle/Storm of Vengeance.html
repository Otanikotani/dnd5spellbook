            A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you
            can see and spreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning
            flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong winds
            roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000
            feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must make a
            Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
            takes <b>2d6 </b>thunder damage and becomes deafened
            for 5 minutes.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each round you maintain concentration on this spell,
            the storm produces additional effects on your turn.

            </p>
            <p>
            Round 2. Acidic rain falls from the cloud.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each creature and object under the cloud takes
            <b>1d6 </b>acid damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            Round 3. You call six bolts of lightning from the
            cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice
            beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can't be
            struck by m ore than one bolt. A struck creature must
            make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes
            <b>10d6 </b>lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much
            damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            Round 4. Hailstones rain down from the
            cloud. Each creature under the cloud takes <b>2d6</b>
            bludgeoning damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            Round 5-10. Gusts and freezing rain assail the
            area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult
            terrain and is heavily obscured. Each creature there
            takes <b>1d6 </b>cold damage. Ranged w eapon attacks in
            the area are impossible. The w ind and rain count as
            a severe distraction for the purposes of maintaining
            concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind
            (ranging from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically
            disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena in the area,
            whether mundane or magical.
