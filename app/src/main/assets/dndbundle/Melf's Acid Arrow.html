            A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target
            within range and bursts in a spray of acid. Make a
            ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the
            target takes <b>4d4 </b>acid damage immediately and <b>2d4 </b>acid
            damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow
            splashes the target with acid for half as much of the
            initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial
            and later) increases by <b>1d4 </b>for each slot level above 2nd.
