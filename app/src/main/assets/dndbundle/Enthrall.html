            You weave a distracting string of words, causing
            creatures of your choice that you can see within range
            and that can hear you to make a W isdom saving
            throw. Any creature that can't be charmed succeeds
            on this saving throw automatically, and if you or your
            companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on
            the save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage
            on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to perceive any
            creature other than you until the spell ends or until the
            target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are
            incapacitated or can no longer speak.
