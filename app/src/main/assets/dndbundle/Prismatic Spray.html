            Eight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each ray is a different color and has a different power
            and purpose. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must
            make a Dexterity saving throw. For each target, roll a d8
            to determine which color ray affects it.

            </p>
            <p>
            1. Red. The target takes <b>10d6 </b>fire damage on a failed
            save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            2. Orange. The target takes <b>10d6 </b>acid damage on a
            failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            3. Yellow. The target takes <b>10d6 </b>lightning damage on a
            failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            4. Green. The target takes <b>10d6 </b>poison damage on a
            failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            5. Blue. The target takes <b>10d6 </b>cold damage on a failed
            save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            6. Indigo. On a failed save, the target is restrained.

            </p>
            <p>
            It must then make a Constitution saving throw at the
            end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three
            times, the spell ends. If it fails its save three times,
            it permanently turns to stone and is subjected to the
            petrified condition. The successes and failures don't
            need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the
            target collects three of a kind.

            </p>
            <p>
            7. Violet. On a failed save, the target is blinded. It
            must then make a W isdom saving throw at the start of
            your next turn. A successful save ends the blindness. If
            it fails that save, the creature is transported to another
            plane of existence of the DM's choosing and is no longer
            blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn't
            its home plane is banished home, while other creatures
            are usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)
            8. Special. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice
            more, rerolling any 8.
