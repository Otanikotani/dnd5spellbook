            This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds,
            spawning delusions and provoking uncontrolled action.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on
            a point you choose within range must succeed on a
            Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be
            affected by it.

            </p>
            <p>
            An affected target can't take reactions and must roll
            a d 10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its
            behavior for that turn.

            </p>
            <p>
            At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can
            make a W isdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect
            ends for that target.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 5th level or higher, the radius of the sphere
            increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 4th.
