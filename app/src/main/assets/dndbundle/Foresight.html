            You touch a w illing creature and bestow a limited ability
            to see into the immediate future. For the duration, the
            target can't be surprised and has advantage on attack
            rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally,
            other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls
            against the target for the duration.
