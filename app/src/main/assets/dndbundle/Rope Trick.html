            You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long.

            </p>
            <p>
            One end of the rope then rises into the air until the
            whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground. At the
            upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an
            extradimensional space that lasts until the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            The extradimensional space can be reached by
            climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as
            many as eight Medium or smaller creatures. The rope
            can be pulled into the space, making the rope disappear
            from view outside the space.

            </p>
            <p>
            Attacks and spells can't cross through the entrance
            into or out of the extradimensional space, but those
            inside can see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot
            window centered on the rope.

            </p>
            <p>
            Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out
            when the spell ends.

            </p>
