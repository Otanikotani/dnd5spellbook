            You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellowgreen
            fog centered on a point you choose within range.

            </p>
            <p>
            The fog spreads around corners. It lasts for the duration
            or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            Its area is heavily obscured.

            </p>
            <p>
            When a creature enters the spell's area for the first
            time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must
            make a Constitution saving throw. The creature takes
            <b>5d8 </b>poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
            damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected
            even if they hold their breath or don't need to breathe.

            </p>
            <p>
            The fog m oves 10 feet away from you at the start
            of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the
            ground. The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the
            lowest level of the land, even pouring down openings.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 6th level or higher, the damage increases by
            <b>1d8 </b>for each slot level above 5th.
