            The next time you hit a creature with a melee w eapon
            attack during this spell's duration, your weapon flares
            with bright light, and the attack deals an extra <b>3d8</b>
            radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target
            must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be
            blinded until the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            A creature blinded by this spell makes another
            Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.

            </p>
            <p>
            On a successful save, it is no longer blinded.
