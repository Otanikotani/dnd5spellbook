            The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point
            within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns.

            </p>
            <p>
            The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes
            <b>2d4 </b>piercing damage for every 5 feet it travels.

            </p>
            <p>
            The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to
            look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the
            time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception)
            check against your spell save DC to recognize the
            terrain as hazardous before entering it.
