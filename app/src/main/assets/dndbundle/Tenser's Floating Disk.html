            This spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force,
            3 feet in diameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet
            above the ground in an unoccupied space of your choice
            that you can see within range. The disk remains for the
            duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If more weight
            is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the disk
            falls to the ground.

            </p>
            <p>
            The disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of
            it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the disk
            follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It
            can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs,
            slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change
            of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can't move
            across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it
            was created at the bottom.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically
            because it can't move around an obstacle tofollow you),
            the spell ends.
