            Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack
            against a creature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict
            the creature with a disease of your choice from any of
            the ones described below.

            </p>
            <p>
            At the end of each of the target's turns, it must make
            a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of
            these saving throws, the disease's effects last for the
            duration, and the creature stops making these saves.

            </p>
            <p>
            After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the
            creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            Since this spell induces a natural disease in its
            target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise
            ameliorates a disease's effects apply to it.

            </p>
            <p>

            and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has
            disadvantage on Wisdom checks and W isdom saving
            throws and is blinded.

            </p>
            <p>
            Filth Fever. A raging fever sweeps through the
            creature's body. The creature has disadvantage on
            Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack
            rolls that use Strength.

            </p>
            <p>
            Flesh Rot. The creature's flesh decays. The creature

            to all damage.

            <p>
            Mindfire. The creature's mind becomes feverish. The
            creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and
            Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as
            if under the effects of the confusion spell during combat.

            </p>
            <p>
            Seizure. The creature is overcome with shaking.

            </p>
            <p>
            The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks,
            Dexterity saving throws, and attack rolls that
            use Dexterity.

            </p>
            <p>
            Slimy Doom. The creature begins to bleed
            uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on
            Constitution checks and Constitution saving throws.

            </p>
            <p>
            In addition, whenever the creature takes damage, it is
            stunned until the end of its next turn.
