            You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of
            casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd
            level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is
            casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability
            check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10
            + the spell's level. On a success, the creature's spell fails
            and has no effect.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 4th level or higher, the interrupted spell has
            no effect if its level is less than or equal to the level of the
            spell slot you used.
