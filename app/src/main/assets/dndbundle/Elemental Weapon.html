            A nonmagical weapon you touch becomes a magic
            weapon. Choose one of the following damage types:
            acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder. For the duration,
            the weapon has a +1 bonus to attack rolls and deals an
            extra <b>1d4 </b>damage of the chosen type when it hits.

            increases to +2 and the extra damage increases to
            <b>2d4</b>. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher,
            the bonus increases to +3 and the extra damage
            increases to <b>3d4</b>.
