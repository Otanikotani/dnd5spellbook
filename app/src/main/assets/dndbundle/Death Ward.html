            You touch a creature and grant it a measure of
            protection from death.

            The first time the target w ould drop to 0 hit points as a
            result of taking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit
            point, and the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected
            to an effect that would kill it instantaneously without
            dealing damage, that effect is instead negated against
            the target, and the spell ends.
