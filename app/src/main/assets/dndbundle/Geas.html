            You place a magical command on a creature that you
            can see within range, forcing it to carry out some
            service or refrain from some action or course of activity
            as you decide. If the creature can understand you, it
            must succeed on a W isdom saving throw or b ecome
            charmed by you for the duration. While the creature
            is charmed by you, it takes 5 d10 psychic damage
            each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your
            instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature
            that can't understand you is unaffected by the spell.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can issue any command you choose, short of an
            activity that would result in certain death. Should you
            issue a suicidal command, the spell ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can end the spell early by using an action to
            dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration, or wish
            spell also ends it.

            </p>

            At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using
            a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year.

            </p>
            <p>
            When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level,
            the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the spells
            mentioned above.
