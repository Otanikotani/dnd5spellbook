            Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square
            centered on a point within range and turns it into
            difficult terrain for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the grease appears, each creature standing in
            its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall
            prone. A creature that enters the area or ends its turn
            there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
            or fall prone.
