            You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the
            target's movement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and
            spells and other magical effects can neither reduce
            the target's speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed
            or restrained.

            </p>
            <p>
            The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to
            automatically escape from nonmagical restraints, such
            as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally,
            being underwater imposes no penalties on the target's
            movement or attacks.
