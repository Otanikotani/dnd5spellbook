            You create a shadowy d oor on a flat solid surface that
            you can see within range. The door is large enough to
            allow Medium creatures to pass through unhindered.

            </p>
            <p>
            When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that
            appears to be an empty room 30 feet in each dimension,
            made of wood or stone. When the spell ends, the door
            disappears, and any creatures or objects inside the
            demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also
            disappears from the other side.

            </p>
            <p>
            Each time you cast this spell, you can create a new
            demiplane, or have the shadowy door connect to a
            demiplane you created with a previous casting of this
            spell. Additionally, if you know the nature and contents
            of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by
            another creature, you can have the shadowy door
            connect to its demiplane instead.
