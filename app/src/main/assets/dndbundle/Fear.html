            You project a phantasmal image of a creature's worst
            fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on
            a W isdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding
            and become frightened for the duration.

            </p>
            <p>
            While frightened by this spell, a creature must take
            the Dash action and move away from you by the safest
            available route on each of its turns, unless there is
            nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a
            location where it doesn't have line of sight to you,
            the creature can make a W isdom saving throw. On a
            successful save, the spell ends for that creature.
