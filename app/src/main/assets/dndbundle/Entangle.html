            Grasping w eeds and vines sprout from the ground in a
            20-foot square starting from a point within range. For
            the duration, these plants turn the ground in the area
            into difficult terrain.

            </p>

            A creature in the area when you cast the spell must
            succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained
            by the entangling plants until the spell ends. A creature
            restrained by the plants can use its action to make
            a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a
            success, it frees itself.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
