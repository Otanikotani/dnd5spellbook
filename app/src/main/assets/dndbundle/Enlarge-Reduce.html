            You cause a creature or an object you can see within
            range to grow larger or smaller for the duration. Choose
            either a creature or an object that is neither w orn
            nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a
            Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell
            has no effect.

            </p>
            <p>
            If the target is a creature, everything it is w earing and
            carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an
            affected creature returns to normal size at once.

            </p>
            <p>
            Enlarge. The target's size doubles in all dimensions,
            and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth
            increases its size by one category—from Medium to
            Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the
            target to double its size, the creature or object attains
            the maximum possible size in the space available.

            </p>
            <p>
            Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on
            Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The
            target's weapons also grow to match its new size. While
            these weapons are enlarged, the target's attacks with
            them deal <b>1d4 </b>extra damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            Reduce. The target's size is halved in all dimensions,
            and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This
            reduction decreases its size by one category—from
            Medium to Small, for example. Until the spell ends,
            the target also has disadvantage on Strength checks
            and Strength saving throws. The target's weapons also
            shrink to match its new size. While these weapons are
            reduced, the target's attacks with them deal <b>1d4 </b>less
            damage (this can't reduce the damage below 1).
