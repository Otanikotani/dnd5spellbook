            Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to
            a creature you try to touch. Make a melee spell attack
            against the target. You have advantage on the attack roll
            if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit,
            the target takes <b>1d8 </b>lightning damage, and it can't take
            reactions until the start of its next turn.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell's damage increases by <b>1d8 </b>when you reach
            5th level (<b>2d8</b>), 11th level (<b>3d8</b>), and 17th level (<b>4d8</b>).
