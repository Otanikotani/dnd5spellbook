            For the spell's duration, your eyes become an inky void
            imbued with dread power. One creature of your choice
            within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed
            on a W isdom saving throw or be affected by one of the
            following effects of your choice for the duration. On
            each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use
            your action to target another creature but can't target
            a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw
            against this casting of eyebite.

            </p>
            <p>
            Asleep. The target falls unconscious. It w akes up if it
            takes any damage or if another creature uses its action
            to shake the sleeper awake.

            </p>
            <p>
            Panicked. The target is frightened of you. On each
            of its turns, the frightened creature must take the
            Dash action and move away from you by the safest and
            shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to
            move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away
            from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.

            </p>
            <p>
            Sickened. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls
            and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can
            make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds,
            the effect ends.

            </p>
