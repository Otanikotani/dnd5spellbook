            You touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the
            poison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you
            neutralize one poison that you know is present, or you
            neutralize one at random.

            </p>
            <p>
            For the duration, the target has advantage on saving
            throws against being poisoned, and it has resistance to
            poison damage.
