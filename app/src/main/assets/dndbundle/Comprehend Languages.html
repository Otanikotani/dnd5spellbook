            For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of
            any spoken language that you hear. You also understand
            any written language that you see, but you must be
            touching the surface on which the w ords are written. It
            takes about 1 minute to read one page of text.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell doesn't decode secret messages in a text
            or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn't part of a
            written language.
