            A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-footradius,
            40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within
            range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.

            </p>
            <p>
            When a creature enters the spell's area for the first
            time on a turn or starts its turn there, it is engulfed
            in ghostly flames that cause searing pain, and it must
            make a Constitution saving throw. It takes <b>2d10 </b>radiant
            damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
            successful one.

            </p>
            <p>
            A shapechanger makes its saving throw with
            disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to its
            original form and can't assume a different form until it
            leaves the spell's light.

            </p>
            <p>
            On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can
            use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.

            </p>
            <p>
            At Higher Levels. W hen you cast this spell using a
            spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by
            1dlO for each slot level above 2nd.
