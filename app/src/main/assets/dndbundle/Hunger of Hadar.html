            You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a
            region infested with unknown horrors. A 20-foot-radius
            sphere of blackness and bitter cold appears, centered
            on a point with range and lasting for the duration. This
            void is filled with a cacophony of soft whispers and
            slurping noises that can be heard up to 30 feet away. No
            light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and
            creatures fully within the area are blinded.

            </p>
            <p>
            The void creates a warp in the fabric of space, and the
            area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn
            in the area takes <b>2d6 </b>cold damage. Any creature that
            ends its turn in the area must succeed on a Dexterity
            saving throw or take <b>2d6 </b>acid damage as milky,
            otherworldly tentacles rub against it.
