            Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is
            immune to psychic damage, any effect that would sense
            its emotions or read its thoughts, divination spells, and
            the charmed condition. The spell even foils wish spells
            and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the
            target's mind or to gain information about the target.
