            Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in
            blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in
            the area when the spell is cast is also outlined in light if
            it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects
            and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius.

            </p>
            <p>
            Any attack roll against an affected creature or object
            has advantage if the attacker can see it, and the affected
            creature or object can't benefit from being invisible.
