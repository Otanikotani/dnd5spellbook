            <p>
            You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to
            three questions that can be answered with a yes or no.

            </p>
            <p>
            You must ask your questions before the spell ends. You
            receive a correct answer for each question.

            </p>
            <p>
            Divine beings aren't necessarily omniscient, so you
            might receive “unclear” as an answer if a question
            pertains to information that lies beyond the deity's
            knowledge. In a case where a one-word answer could be
            misleading or contrary to the deity's interests, the DM
            might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you cast the spell two or more times before finishing
            your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent
            chance for each casting after the first that you get no
            answer. The DM makes this roll in secret.
