            For the duration, you sense the presence of magic
            within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you
            can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible
            creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you
            learn its school of magic, if any.

            The spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked
            by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet
            of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
