            You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead
            humanoid. Provided that the creature has been dead no
            longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body
            for it and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the
            target's soul isn't free or w illing to do so, the spell fails.

            The magic fashions a new body for the creature
            to inhabit, which likely causes the creature's race to
            change. The DM rolls a d 100 and consults the following
            table to determine what form the creature takes when
            restored to life, or the DM chooses a form.

            The reincarnated creature recalls its former life
            and experiences. It retains the capabilities it had in its
            original form, except it exchanges its original race for
            the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly.
