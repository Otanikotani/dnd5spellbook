            You and up to eight w illing creatures who link hands in
            a circle are transported to a different plane of existence.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can specify a target destination in general terms,
            such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of
            Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the
            Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination.

            </p>
            <p>
            If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example,
            you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of
            Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire,
            at the DM's discretion.

            </p>
            <p>
            Alternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a
            teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this
            spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation
            circle is too small to hold all the creatures you
            transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied
            spaces next to the circle.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature
            to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach
            and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the
            creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the
            creature fails this save, it is transported to a random
            location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature
            so transported must find its own way back to your
            current plane of existence.
