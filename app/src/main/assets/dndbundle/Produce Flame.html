            A flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame
            remains there for the duration and harms neither you
            nor your equipment. The flame sheds bright light in a
            10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

            </p>
            <p>
            The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or if you
            cast it again.

            </p>
            <p>
            You can also attack with the flame, although doing so
            ends the spell. When you cast this spell, or as an action
            on a later turn, you can hurl the flame at a creature
            within 30 feet of you. Make a ranged spell attack. On a
            hit, the target takes <b>1d8 </b>fire damage.

            </p>
            <p>
            This spell's damage increases by <b>1d8 </b>when you reach
            5th level (<b>2d8</b>), 11th level (<b>3d8</b>), and 17th level (<b>4d8</b>).
