            Until the spell ends, the target's speed is doubled, it
            gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity
            saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each
            of its turns. That action can be used only to take the
            Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide,
            or Use an Object action.

            </p>
            <p>
            When the spell ends, the target can't move or take
            actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy
            sweeps over it.
